# 💳 Banking Management System

## 📌 Project Overview

This **Banking Management System** is a simple console-based application developed using **C++**. It allows users to perform basic banking operations such as:

- Creating new accounts
- Viewing existing accounts
- Depositing and withdrawing money
- Modifying account details
- Deleting accounts
- Viewing all customer details

It uses **file handling** (`fstream`) to store account information persistently in a `.dat` file. This project is built with a focus on understanding object-oriented programming and file management in C++.
